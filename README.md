# Py to Block Diagram

## Generate Block Diagram based on your Python code

Why? In college, it is often required to create flowcharts. Is it pointless? Yes. In most cases - yes, but who cares? :(

## Usage

- install dependencies `pip install -r requirments.txt`

- write algorithm as a function in `main.py`

- run server by `uvicorn server:app` or one of ours `bat`/`sh` files

- when your code is ready generate `svg` and `png` files by opening `localhost:8000/www`
